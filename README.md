# movie-genre-predictor
We all have been fascinated by movies for a long time. Most of us will have an idea on what the movie might be about on hearing the name itself.
This project is similar. This project implements a movie genre prediction model based on the movie name.
"movies.csv" contains the name of around 193886 movies along with their genres.
A movie can have multiple genres associated with it. Our model predicts one of the genre associated with the movie at a time.

Excited to see our model work?
Here is a produt walkthrough


## How it works

The user interacts with the web application, currently hosted on Anvil,which is a platform for building and hosting full-stack web apps written entirely in Python.
There, the user can enter the name of the movie and then the trained model makes the prediction about the genres of the movie.
